# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a blockchain development project that utilizes Hardhat, a popular Ethereum development environment, to simplify the process of building, testing, and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages various libraries and tools to provide a comprehensive toolset for developers.

## Installation
To get started with User Workspace, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)

   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start using User Workspace for your development needs. The primary command to run the project is:
